Contract tracing implements an algorithm in conjunction with an RTLS system to uniquely identify personnel. At a specified period, sensors will record everyone located in a specific space and this information is recorded.  This information will be recorded on a rotating basis which is configurable with newer records replacing the oldest.  Once an individual has been determined to be positive for Covid-19, their previous movements can be queried and those individuals who were exposed to them can be easily calculated.
