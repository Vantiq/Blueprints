The Access Management plugin can be used to identify people who have been exposed to the coronavirus or how have demonstrated symptoms of Covid-19 and based upon a configurable set of rules, the date when that individual can safely return to work can be calculated.  If that individual attempts to return to work from self-quarantine prior to this date, facial recognition, an employee badge or other methods can be used to identify the employee and flag them as not yet being able to safely return from quarantine.
