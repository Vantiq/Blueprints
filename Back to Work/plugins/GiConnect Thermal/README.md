Thermal cameras can be used to measure skin temperatures of people and this measurement can be used as a first level indicator that an employee or visitor potentially has a fever. Individuals with an elevated skin temperature can be identified in a crowd or at an entry point into a facility and once that identification is made, additional secondary steps can be initiated to further determine the health status of the individual.
