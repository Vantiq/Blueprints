# Blueprints
The Blueprints repo contains working examples that can be imported by users to jumpstart development by providing a (mostly) working example application. Some configuration and tweaking may be required.

Each Blueprint takes the form of an export from a VANTIQ system and should appear as a uniquely named top-level folder in this repository.

Blueprints should be made by members of the VANTIQ Sales Engineering Team. To add a blueprint, open a pull request against this repository with your suggested additions and it will be reviewed by a member of the VANTIQ team before being merged into the repository.

To import a Blueprint in Modelo, go to the Projects dropdown and click Imports. In the import popup select Blueprints from the import type droplist and browse the subsequent list to view the available blueprints.
